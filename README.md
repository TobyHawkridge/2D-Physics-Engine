This project is a 2D physics engine being made in the coding language 'C'.

RayLib is needed to run this project currrently, this may change in the future. The RayLib installer is on 'https://raylib.com' (it asks for a donation but you can just click past it with the 'just take me to the download' button). Make sure you really want RayLib installed because the installer is 647mb and the lib is 1.79gb.

The project is currently just a 500px x 500px black screen popping up.

To run the project, open main.exe.
