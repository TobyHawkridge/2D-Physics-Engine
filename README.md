This project is a 2D physics engine being made in the coding language 'C'.

RayLib is needed to run this project currrently, this may change in the future. The RayLib installer is on 'https://raylib.com' (it asks for a donation but you can just click to the actual download with the 'No thanks, just take me to the downloads' button). Make sure you really want RayLib installed because the installer is 647mb and the lib is 1.79gb.

The project is currently a black screen popup that opens auto maximized and fullscreen. To exit the program, press esc or manually close it with the x button in the top right. To toggle black and white background, hold and let go of the backspace. Held down is a white background and not held is a black background. When you hold the '1' key, a square with an opposite colour to the background (e.g. black background but white square) and you can hold the '2' key for a second square. Use the arrow keys whilst the shapes are showing to move that particular shape. 

To use the project, run main.exe.
